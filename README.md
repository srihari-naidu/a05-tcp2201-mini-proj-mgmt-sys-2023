# MMU Online Mini-project Management System

The MMU Online Mini-project Management System is an online tool for MMU lecturers and students who are registered with the mini-project subject. The system consists of three main users: Admin, Lecturer, and Student. The Admin is responsible for providing usernames and passwords to the lecturers and students, as well as adding, deleting, and commenting on projects. The Lecturer can upload the content of mini-projects to the system and assign them to students according to their specialization. The students are divided according to their specialization and are only allowed to access projects under their specialization.
